'''
The code to the left creates a class called Bank. This class has a branch name, the number of customers, and a list of the amount of money in each customerâ€™s bank account. The method branch_total takes the list of customer money and returns the total amount of money held by the bank.
Create the class RegionalBank as a child of the Bank class. This class has a name, the number of customers in the region, and a 2D list of all of the money in the bank accounts for each branch. Extend the RegionalBank class by adding the method regional_total which returns the total amount of money kept in all of the banks in the region.
Instantiate an object from the RegionalBank class and use the variable accounts as the 2D list of bank account. Print out the result from regional_total.
Expected Output
The TRY IT button will run your code with the following value for the accounts variable. Your program should print 170000.
accounts = [
              [10000, 13000, 22000],
              [30000, 7000, 19000],
              [15000, 23000, 31000]
           ]
